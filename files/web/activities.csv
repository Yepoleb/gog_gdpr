It currently only has a console interface and is very limited in functionality. The supported games at the moment are limited to the Stardew Valley beta, but if you find other games that have unused Galaxy functionality on Linux or are in contact with a developer who is willing to release an unofficial build, I'm going to try my best to make it work. Supported binary distros are Debian Buster, Sid and Ubuntu 18.04, others are only supported when built from source. \n  \n The rest of this post is basically copied from the README, so look there if the post happens to get outdated. \n  \n [b]Usage[/b] \n  \n 1. Create the directories \""~/.local/share/comet\"" and \""~/.local/share/comet/peer\"" \n 2. Create auth token using \""cometd create-token\"" \n 3. Copy \""libGalaxyPeer64.so\"" or \""libGalaxyPeer.so\"" from a supported game to \n    \""~/.local/share/comet/peer\"". The architecture has to match the one of the \n    game executable, so it's best to copy both if available. \n 3. Run daemon with \""cometd\"" \n  \n [b]Depencendies[/b] \n  \n * [url=https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/]libcurl[/url] (APT: libcurl4) \n * [url=https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/]libprotobuf[/url] (APT: libprotobuf10) \n  \n [b]Downloads[/b] \n  \n Binary: [url=https://gitlab.com/Yepoleb/comet/tags]https://gitlab.com/Yepoleb/comet/tags[/url] \n Source: [url=https://gitlab.com/Yepoleb/comet]https://gitlab.com/Yepoleb/comet[/url] \n  \n [b]License[/b] \n  \n GPLv3""}","2018-06-11 21:08:01"
