It\'ll be in two parts due to GOG\'s character limit. \n  \n   Format is: \n   ""LIBRARY_ID"" =&gt; [CATALOGUE_ID, ""DESCRIPTIVE_NAME"" \n  \n   Note: If a game has multiple editions (e.g. Tyranny), the library ID is associated with the catalogue ID of the base (non-premium) edition (e.g. Commander Edition). \n  \n   Good luck. \n  \n   P.S.

I tried the projects I have that use authentication and they have the same result. \n  \n   You know, there was a serious security problem with the way it had been working. You could have a website which used auth.gog.com to allow users to log in and they would think it was similar to logging into a site through Steam. In fact, GOG's auth page is completely different. If you log into a site through Steam all you're doing is proving that you are the owner of that Steam account. With auth.gog.com you are actually authorising a token that gives the site near-complete control of your GOG profile - [u]but[/u] very few people would expect that behaviour so it would be perfect for scamming. (although to my knowledge nobody has tried this so far). \n  \n   This risk has been bothering me for a while and I actually decided just a moment ago to come to this very thread to warn about signing into strangers' sites through auth.gog.com and suggest that GOG limit authentication to certain registered domains. It's quite a coincidence to come here just a few hours after jamieadkins95 discovered that that had already done this. \n  \n   It's a good thing, really, but it also sucks because now we lack 2 important services: a way for our custom tools to access our accounts, and a way for users to verify their accounts to 3rd party sites [i]without[/i] handing over the keys in the process. \n  #Q&_^Q&Q#LINK:31#Q&_^Q&Q#[/quote] \n  \n I know, the previous implementation was insecure and violated the OAuth2 standard.

TW2 for Linux uses eON wrapper from VP. The way such games work is similar to Wine, except they do static translation, rather than dynamic. I.e. Wine redirects calls at runtime, and translates Windows API into Linux equivalent functionality. Static translation on the other hand uses the source code, so it can be more focused and less generic. That\'s what Feral do as well. I\'d say it performs pretty well. Of course it\'s still not a normal engine rewrite. But it\'s clearly a cheap way to make such a port. \n  #Q&_^Q&Q#LINK:327#Q&_^Q&Q#[/quote] \n  \n eON does not do static translation, it loads a Windows executable exactly like Wine. For TW2 the ""witcher2"" may look like a native binary, but the actual game seems to be inside ""witcher2.vpfs"". If you take a look inside that, it immediately starts with a PE header, easy to identify by the ""This program cannot be run in DOS mode"" string. But that\'s probably not the reason why Virtual Programming ports are so hated, as Wine can yield acceptable performance, even without any customization. From my experience they\'re just really shitty at dealing with support and often keep issues unresolved for a long time. Feral and Aspyr do use static translation and have a much better reputation inside the Linux gaming community.'","2017-02-24 04:18:06"

Databases are of course not immune to this (they too run files on a regular filesystem in most scenarios), but they are by their nature a lot more pro-active at letting you know that your content was corrupted at which point you can take action rather than unknowingly sit on corrupted data. \n  \n   Also, overall, I got a lot of pre-existing knowledge with MongoDB (I took a bunch of online courses and have a double-certification). It's relatively easy for me to add/remove replicas for storage redundancy or just to deprecate or add storage medium. \n  \n   For me, putting and retrieving files from a remote database is a lot less hassle and more portable than having to manage, replicate and move around a filesystem directory structure. \n  \n   In a previous place of employment, we originally stored media files in a directory structure and that proved to be a mess to maintain. Moving it to a database proved to be a net gain for us (from there, you could remotely access files, replicate them, shard them and overall handle them just like other database documents). \n  \n   Now, they were not 1GB+ files and you a probably right that if you want to do a lot of manipulation on the entire file, the chucks may be a drawback, but for storage and retrieval? Why not? \n  #Q&_^Q&Q#LINK:60#Q&_^Q&Q#[/quote] \n  \n You'll need specialized tools for absolutely everything instead of being able to use the massive amount of existing programs to manage your files. Performance will be garbage, ram usage through the roof and your time wasted on glueing together components that were never designed for that purpose.

You first need to pay the higher price to get that game, that's a given. And the cut of that higher price also most likely goes to the publisher, which is the unfair part. That you may later use the difference for another game, [b]if you purchase it within a year and using the same currency[/b] is a different thing. If you buy few games and a year may pass between them or tend to switch currencies if the exchange rates vary or depending on payment method, the FPP may expire, or you may feel you're forced to buy something you otherwise wouldn't to use it. But regardless of all of this, you do need to pay the higher price first, that's a given. The FPP absolutely must NOT be factored into the game's listed price. \n  #Q&_^Q&Q#LINK:225#Q&_^Q&Q#[/quote] \n  \n You're not wrong, but I think that's just nitpicking. People who only buy a game every few years are definitely not the target demographic of GOG DB and probably don't mind paying a few dollars more just that one time. I have no interest in supporting this pointless fight against publisher injustice when there are a ton of more interesting things to do that actually contribute something to the gaming environment.""","2018-04-04 03:29:15"

Check back later for the changelog, it's going to be big. \n  \n Edit: \n  \n [b]Major Changes[/b] \n  \n - Added support for non-store games \n - Added a search field to the header \n - Empty values and sections are now hidden \n - Correctly handle price values for games that are not sold \n - Added base game to the info section and added a separate DLCs section under details \n - Added userscript that adds a GOG DB button to store pages \n  \n [b]Minor Changes[/b] \n  \n - Allow searching by product ID \n - Removed content system tracking and deleted previous entries because they were very unreliable \n - Removed support link because it was even more unreliable \n - Language codes are in all caps \n - Download languages are now in English \n - Rewrote tabs code to handle the browser back button correctly \n - Products search bar has a purple shadow when selected \n - Added a hidden text element after all icons to make them visible in terminal browsers like lynx and links2 \n  \n [b]Technical Changes[/b] \n  \n - Improved changelog load times \n - Improved image loading times \n - Optimized logo filesize \n - Added more favicon sizes \n - Changed the feed post id to be consistent between all python versions \n - Removed unused font \n - Added slug to ID map to improve integration with other websites \n - Increased cache time for page assets \n - Enabled gzip compression of SVG images \n - Respond to missing products with 404 instead crashing \n  \n Something else I tried was adding navigation buttons at the top of the page instead of just the bottom, but with the current design that looked horrible. I'll have to put some more time into improving it before I feel comfortable making this change. \n  \n Lastly I want to thank Aemony, Cat, Garrett, Jeth Calark, Marioysikax, omega64, savePinball, SuicideMachine and Vetle from the PCGamingWiki Discord for sending me their libraries so most of the unlisted games could be added. \n  \n Thanks for reading, I hope you like the new features! \n  \n Edit 2: \n  \n I forgot to mention, the userscript is available at [url=https://www.gogdb.org/gogdb.user.js]https://www.gogdb.org/gogdb.user.js[/url].""","2018-04-18 03:33:18"
